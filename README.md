# VolunteerHub-Challenge
Volunteer Hub web API using NodeJS, Express, JWT, bCrypt, MongoDb, Mongoose


This small project is a coding challenge to demonstrate how to create a RESTful web API using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, and Bcrypt using chained promises (no async/await) and error handling. It also provides the best practices for connecting and disconnecting from a MongoDB database, and uses a cluster for high availability.
